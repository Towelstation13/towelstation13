      with the orderable kit from cargo.)
  - balance: Virus severity is now also a function of the number of symptoms out of

      self-cure at the tradeoff of stats.
  - admin: Object Possession has been reworked, please report any potential bugs.
  - qol: Object Possession should now throw a screen alert for you to unpossess the
      object instead of you having to search the stat-panel for the "release obj"

      work now.
  - bugfix: fixed big rice pans getting worse with cooking.
