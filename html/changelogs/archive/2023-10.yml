  Paxilmaniac:
  - rscadd: The icewalker camp has been completely remade to be less of a single house
      in the middle of hell, to a location befitting our viking felines. As a side
      effect, the spawn of the camp is now static and in the corner of the map, because
      the ruin loader really did not enjoy the size of the templates.
  - image: Sprites for all of the forging related structures have been redone because
      I REALLY hated what I did with them before
  - image: Several new sprites for things like wooden shelves, barrels, and so on,
      all made by yours truly
